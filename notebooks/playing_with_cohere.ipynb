      "Body: construction activity grew steadily by 4 in the second quarter of the first three months of 2021 and recovered quickly and significantly in the same quarter of 2020 due to the low base effect of covid famous economist dr roerofubota said yesterday in the announcement of the afrimat construction index aci and on behalf of afrimat he said aci reached 1103 points in the second half of 2021 and reached a 55 rebound compared to the same quarter last year  the construction industry continues to improve he said in a telephone interview quarterly improvements were driven by a significant increase in employment in the construction sector and sales of building materials since the second quarter of 2020 the construction industry has created approximately 156000 jobs bota said other promising improvements in the building blocks are the value of the building plans passed and the value of the buildings completed by the larger municipalities of the country “unfortunately the postpandemic construction recovery remains incomplete with the second quarter 68 behind covid the same quarter of 2019” but bota said he was confident that it would continue damage to buildings from july riots and looting and potential additional spending on buildings repairs and security in kwazulunatal and houten could boost construction activity in the third and perhaps fourth quarters he said it was highly sexual  inflation has begun to fall in recent months well below the south african reserve bank’s upper inflation target this means that interest rates may remain low until 2022 “a 30 reduction in the cost of mortgages at prime rates has already helped us to return to higher home prices and increase the value of new mortgages” he said in addition two business confidences recorded an immediate recovery from the decline following the july unrest according to bota several companies that have a strong foothold in the construction sector’s value chain have recently released impressive financial results examples include jselisted cashbuild and murray  roberts which show that purchase orders have reached a new record of r607 billion “but now all eyes will focus on the government’s reconstruction and reconstruction plans it’s far behind the starting block” he hopes that further relaxation of blockade regulations and tax jackpots against the backdrop of record mining sector interests will contribute to the faster implementation of this plan andries van heerden ceo of afrimat is slowly but feeling positive economic momentum within the group to accelerate the longawaited infrastructure project ready to run the business he said he needed momentum and commitment from the government the construction sector is expected to be boosted by riots and looting repairs source linkwwwiolcozabusinessreportcompaniesconstructionsectorprojectedtobeboostedbyriotingandlootingrepairs0d6b4e8fc4564f708b937c8fc591d1c1 the construction sector is expected to be boosted by riots and looting repairs\n",
